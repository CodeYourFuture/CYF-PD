## What is CYF PD?

CYF PD is a microsite to help us develop PD content. It is a place to store and share PD content, and to help us develop new content.

## How does it work?

CYF PD is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static site generator. The content is stored in markdown files, and the site is generated from these files. The site is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). When a change is made to the content, the site is automatically rebuilt and redeployed.
