title: Identify pairs per week
description: In this exercise we will identify people that have the same
  availability and pair them, so they can do some coursework together.
modules: Induction
week: "1"
skills:
  - Professional Basics
objectives:
  - Use a Google sheet to identify and define pairs for the following week's work
time: 15
prep: O﻿ne trainee must volunteer to create a new tab on the existing Google sheet.
introduction: >-
  Looking into the General Weekly Availability that you filled in before the
  induction, we will use each other's availability and identify the best pairs
  to work together.


  To work together, you must be available at similar times - not for the whole week, but for the number of hours needed for prep or coursework in pairs. 


  PS: It’s important to pair with different people in your cohort. There is more diversity, there better your professional competencies will evolve.

      On the Fundamentals section of the course, you should have created a rota spreadsheet of the form “XXX X Rota”, replacing the "X"'s with the name of your region and cohort number.
      For example, "NW 6 Rota" for the cohort in North West and cohort 6.
      
      Double check this rota spreadsheet is bookmarked to your cohort channel and post a link to the spreadsheet on Slack
      
      
      One trainee needs to update this Google sheet “XXX X Rota” on the cohort drive


      * Create a new tab on the spreadsheet called “Pairs Induction”

      * The new tab must have two columns, one with the title “Pair 1” and another for “Pair 2.” 

      * Post a message on the cohort Slack with the shared spreadsheet and the instructions on what to do (see below)


      This tab will be the rota of the coursework.
    name: Creating pairs for the coursework
    time: 5
    goal: Update the shared file in which trainees can organise teamwork rotas
  - name: Create pairs considering trainees' availability
    time: 10
    goal: Connect the people's availability defining the most effective pairs to
      work together

      Multiple tasks need to be done to make this exercise happen, but not all
      of them should be done by one person:


      1. H﻿ow many hours of coursework have to be done in pairs? Double check the issues that have a 🫱🏿‍🫲🏽 Pairs label on this module's backlog
 
      2. Open the "General Weekly Availability" spreadsheet.

      3. Identify who could pair together, considering their availability.

      4. Someone should add these pairs to the other spreadsheet (exercise 1).
