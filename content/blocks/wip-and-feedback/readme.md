      1. Divide into an even number of teams of 3-5 people according to the [spreadsheet from prep](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k__Tgn8SxuoO1VWLQ4sVPqRo2BHdUxJzfc8kGpSLhe0/edit#gid=0) that was posted on your Slack channel.Â  One person from each team is the Product Owner. One person in the session is the Facilitator and makes sure that all teams are following the schedule below.

      2. The Drink Team will be designing a delicious drink for the Biscuit Team, who will be designing a wonderful biscuit for the Drink Team.

      3. There are 3 sprints of 5 minutes each that are broken down as follows.

         * 3 minutes to design the drink or biscuit
         * 1 minute for the Drink Team to demo their drink design to the Biscuit Team and get feedback
         * 1 minute for the Biscuit Team to demo their biscuit design to the Drink Team and get feedback
      4. Designs should be made on paper and consider:

         * Name
         * Ingredients
         * Price
         * Graphics
         * Branding
         * Anything else that your customer wants
      5. During the demo phase, the customer team must vote using [Fist to Five](https://www.lucidmeetings.com/glossary/fist-five) where each customer holds their fist with more fingers the more they like it. The product owner should record the total votes from their customers, and then ask for feedback (but you only have one minute for demo + feedback)

      6. After all sprints have been completed, get together as a whole cohort and consider the following questions:

         * If you had had a single sprint of 9 minutes, do you think your customers would have liked your snack as much?
         * How useful was the feedback from customers, and how did you improve the feedback asked for from each round?
         * How did the feedback you received influence the design of the snack?
         * What proportion of your customers did you satisfy at the end?
         * Would you have personally bought this biscuit or drink?
         * Did you let the Product Owner of your team make the prioritisation decisions? Why?
         * How did you find working in your teams?
         * Were there any features that were added that did not come from customer feedback?
