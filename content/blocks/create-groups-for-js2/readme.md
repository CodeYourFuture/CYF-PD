      T﻿hese are the tasks that must be completed. Organise yourselves so not
      only one person is doing this.


      1. Y﻿ou must consider trainees availability

      2. Y﻿ou must consider how many hours of coursework or prep work has to be done in groups

      3. Y﻿ou then can define the groups (look for diversity, so people that haven't worked together should give it a go, ensure you don't have gendered groups, etc.)

      4. You can use this [link](https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator) to help you allocate people randomly.

      5. Open the existent spreadsheet for pairs/groups and create a new tab called "JS2 Groups". 

      6. Add the groups to the "JS2 Groups" tab

      7. Share the spreadsheet on Slack so it is visible to everyone.
