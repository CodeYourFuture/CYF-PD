      T﻿hese are the tasks that must be completed. Organise yourselves so not
      only one person is doing this.


      1. Y﻿ou must consider trainees availability

      2. Y﻿ou must consider how many hours of coursework or prep work has to be done in groups

      3. Y﻿ou then can define the groups (look for diversity, so people that haven't worked together should give it a go, ensure you don't have gendered groups, etc.)

      4. You can use this [link](https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator) to help you allocate people randomly.

      5. Open the existent spreadsheet for pairs/groups and create a new tab called "React", if this hasn't been done yet

      6. Add the groups to the "React" tab

      7. Share the spreadsheet on Slack so it is visible to everyone.
    goal: Create groups for the next module's group work.
