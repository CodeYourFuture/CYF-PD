      question. Choose an ordinary question.\

      \

      **2. Interviewee:** You must give a **terrible answer** to this question (keep it clean, please!). Then cold call another person to be the interviewer.\

      \

      **3. Interviewer:** Give absolutely straight-faced feedback. If you laugh, you're out and must nominate another player to complete your feedback and return the game to step 1.
