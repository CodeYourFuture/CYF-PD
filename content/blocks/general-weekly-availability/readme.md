  done this yet, take the initiative and do it.
introduction: >-
  S﻿haring our general availability means that you and your peers can identify
  roughly who is available and when. 


  Why is this important? 


  Because you can then identify pairs and groups that can help each other, and helping each other isn't only good for the community and your relationship and makes us feel good about ourselves.

      3. Use the same colour as the example to identify when you are available. 

      4. L﻿eave non-available slots in grey. (Examples of Non-available slots: school pick-up/drop-off times, eating times, individual studying, part-time job, resting time, exercising times, mental health focus, etc. You do not have to detail what you are doing, but consider these when adding your availability)


      T﻿ip: Copy and paste one of the current coloured cells to your cell, this way you don't have to figure out what's the correct colour to use.
