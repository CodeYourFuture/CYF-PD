      1. In groups of 3-4 people, find at least two job opportunities

         * Use the **[LinkedIn Job Search](https://www.linkedin.com/company/job-search/)**
         * **Search for titles** that aren't too generic but not too narrow. For example, software engineering or software developer
         * **Filter** down your search **using the location** you want the job to be in, which is probably where your cohort is.
         * The next **filter** could be the **seniority** of the role. Entry-level is most likely what you are looking for, but a mid-level might also be suitable in some cases. Explore.
         * Agency or **Company**: focus on finding job opportunities directly from a company instead of an agency. Especially if you have a third or second relationship with the hiring person or anyone in that company. 
         * From the outcome, each person should choose one job description, read it and decide, in the group, if and why they should add (or not) this job opportunity.

      2. Add them to the form of your cohort location: [South Africa](https://forms.gle/VS2FzKCYP6KAN91i6), [Glasgow](https://forms.gle/AVYwG7E7grZ9zJJX8), [North West](https://forms.gle/4bCoXycLswrXzQ517), [London](https://forms.gle/cqkjtCcKEtVFz9Q18), [West Midlands](https://forms.gle/nS6NeYAj5254e97Z9)

          *  Filling in the spreadsheet correctly is very important. You can do it via the form linked above or directly in the spreadsheet
          * Add the company name, not the agency
          * The company link and the job link should be from the company website, not from LinkedIn
          * Good quality data will mean everyone has a good overview of what is going on
