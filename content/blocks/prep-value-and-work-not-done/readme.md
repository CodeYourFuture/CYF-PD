  - In three sentences, explain the meaning of value in a work setting.

introduction: >-
  We don’t have jobs just to fill the time. We should focus our efforts on
  delivering as much value as we can. You don’t have to finish everything on
  your to-do list. Whenever you choose to do something, you implicitly choose
  not to do something else. Learn to identify some tasks that will deliver more
  value in your available time.


   


  A typical project can be measured at several stages. The latter measures are closer to value, but these are harder to quantify:


  * Inputs → Effort → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact
