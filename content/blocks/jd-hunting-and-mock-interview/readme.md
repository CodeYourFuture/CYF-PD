  based on the job description of the job they are aiming for.
modules: Databases
week: "3"
skills:
  - Employability
objectives:
  - Learn to identify key elements of a job description.
  - Identify your most relevant qualifications using the job description
    keywords and specific phrases so these can be included and highlighted in
    your resume.

introduction: Hiring managers may sort through hundreds of resumes for a single
  job, meaning they often scan to find the most relevant details. The best way
  to get noticed as a candidate is to tailor your CV to the employer's job
  description.
exercises:
  - name: Review a job description for a software engineer role
    time: 30
    goal: Learn how to identify key elements of the job description that can be used
      to highlight relevant skills and experiences in your resume.

      Form groups of 4 or 5 people. Read the job description you read on the
      prep and together do the following activities:


      **1. Review the job description and discuss (20 minutes):** 


      * Understand employers' wants and the qualifications required to perform the job. 

      * Read its description and write down/highlight any significant keywords related to skills. These may be unique to the job or that repeat throughout the posting. 

      * Take note of specific requirements - necessary education or training and years of experience.

      * Look at the order of the responsibilities listed, as those mentioned first may be more of a priority for the employer. 

      * Mirror the employer's priorities when organising your resume - the first items they mention should be some of the first items you each mention on your CV.


      **2. Write a resume summary (10 minutes):** 


      * Review your general CV and start tailoring it to their needs - focus only on the summary.

      * It’s at the top of your resume, so it is one of the first things a hiring manager sees. Use it to showcase your most relevant skills and accomplishments based on the keywords you highlighted. 

      * Include the job title to which you are applying, proving that this is a personalised CV.

    goal: Get prepared and comfortable with competency-based interviews.
    content: >-
      Trainees should pair up and practice interviewing each other. Use the job
      posting from the previous exercise and the notes you took to complete the
      following activity:


      * One individual will take the role of the interviewer, and the other the role of the candidate.

      * You both should be very familiar with the job posting, if not, review it carefully.

      * Make sure to cover these stages during the interview:

        * Introductions
        * Interviewer: go over the candidate’s CV, and ask at least 5 questions regarding the candidate’s skills and experience as well as the information found in the CV’s summary. Try using the format followed by the questions below and also feel free to use them:

          * Tell me about a time when you did more than what was expected.
          * Tell me about a time when you received harsh feedback.
          * Tell me about a time when you had to deliver results within a tight deadline.
          * Walk me through a time when requirements were not clear by the time development had to start. What did you do?
          * Talk me through one of the projects that you’re proud of.
          * What is the most (technically) challenging task that you’ve encountered?
        * The candidate should use the [STAR method](https://cyf-curriculum.netlify.app/node/sprints/1/prep/) to answer these questions. The interviewer should allow the candidate to ask questions at the end. Remember to always keep in mind what you learned from the job description! 
      * Finally, discuss with each other how the interview went and then swap roles.
