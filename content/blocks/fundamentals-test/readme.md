      Draw a circle and write WORST BOSS. Think about the characteristics of the "Worst Boss", write your ideas on post-its and share them on the collaborative sheet.


       Think about a boss you worked with in the past or a boss you would not want to work for.


      **P﻿art 2**


      Draw another circle and write BEST BOSS. Now think about the characteristics of the "Best Boss" you have ever had or you would want to have, write your ideas on post-its and share them on the collaborative sheet.


      **P﻿art 3**


      Work with your cohort to group the 'hard skills' (technical skills) and the 'soft skills' (professional skills) shared for the "Best Boss". You can move the post-its under these two headings on a separate sheet.
