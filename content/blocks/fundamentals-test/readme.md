  - content: >-
      **Part 1**


      Draw a circle and write WORST BOSS. Think about the characteristics of the "Worst Boss", write your ideas on post-its and share them on the collaborative sheet.


       Think about a boss you worked with in the past or a boss you would not want to work for.


      **Part 2**


      Draw another circle and write BEST BOSS. Now think about the characteristics of the "Best Boss" you have or would want to have. Write your ideas on Post-it (one per Post-it!)  and share them on the collaborative sheet.


      **Part 3**


      Work with your cohort to group the 'hard skills' (technical skills) and the 'soft skills' (professional skills) shared for the "Best Boss". You can move the post-its under these two headings on a separate sheet.


      **Part 4**


      * Discuss what you have learned with this exercise.

      * Define hard (technical) and soft (professional) skills.

      * Are the soft skills really soft?


      **Part 5**
