    goal: Clarify your understanding of a Job Description with a potential employer
    content: >-
      In the same groups you worked on before, discuss questions for employers.


      You don’t want to waste your time or the employer's time applying for jobs that are not a good fit.  So it can be a good idea to ask the recruiter or employer questions about the job you are considering before applying. Some job descriptions are unclear or vague, and you may be uncertain about the core requirements. Also, since this is probably your first contact with the employer, it shows genuine interest in the role and asking good questions early on makes you stand out versus your competition for the job.


      As a group, list good questions to ask the employer or recruiter before applying for the position. What questions should you not ask?  


      *Hint: you want a solid understanding of the role, what the key challenges are, why it is being offered, and what’s expected from you on a typical day, but you want to phrase the questions to make it clear you already know the Job Description thoroughly.*
