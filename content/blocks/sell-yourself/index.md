exercises:
  - name: Brag for your pair
    time: 30
    goal: Express the strengths of another person
    content: >-
      Pair up with someone you know well, someone you worked with together
      before. One of you will act as an interviewer, and the other will be an
      interviewee. Interviewers ask the following questions to their pair. The
      interviewees answer these questions not for themselves but for their pair.
      Interviewees pretend to be in the shoes of their pair and show off their
      pair’s strengths, skills, and achievements. Each of you should play both
      roles, so pay attention to time and don’t spend more than 15 minutes each.
      Put timers on your phones and don’t spend more than 2 minutes for each
      question.


      Interview questions:


      1. Please tell us a little bit about yourself

      2. Can you tell us about an achievement you are proud of?

      3. What is your biggest strength?

      4. Which soft skills do you need to improve further?

      5. Why do you want to become a professional developer?

      6. What can you contribute to our team?


      *Tips for facilitators:* Don’t worry if all questions aren't covered by the end of 15 minutes, stop there and change roles.
  - name: What is your value for a company?
    time: 30
    goal: Express own professional value

      Work as a class. Study [this job
      advertisement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c4VtObskkVB8FVnFdIFiHQO7dgtCXfmkBXvSlRfNAK0/edit?usp=drivesdk).
      Identify the pain points for the company. Remember, it’s not easy for
      employers to find the right candidate. Recruiting is expensive and hard
      for companies. Knowing how to present yourself correctly makes it easier
      for hiring managers to see that you are the right fit for their company.


      * What is the emphasis in the advertisement?

      * What qualities would the best candidate have?

      * What does the company need?

      * How can you help solve their problems?

      * What value will you add when you join their team?


      Brainstorm about how junior devs create value for companies (e.g. by being proactive, by learning fast, etc.). List these traits for junior devs on a board.
