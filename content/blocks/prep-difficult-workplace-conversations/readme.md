  We all find ourselves in situations where we have to have difficult
  conversations with our colleagues at work. Although these are usually
  uncomfortable situations, if we know how to navigate our way through them it
  will help our professional growth and our relationships in the workplace.


  Examples of some difficult situations one has to deal with in the workplace include:


  * You’re overwhelmed with work

  * The job you have is different from the one you applied for

  * You keep running into conflict with a difficult colleague

  * Your manager doesn’t notice the work you do

  * You’ve made a major mistake that truly harmed your team

  * You get a bad performance review

  * You are passed up for a new role in the organisation

  * You find it a struggle to collaborate with your team

  * You feel like the work environment is hostile or inequitable

  * You need help with a mistake that you have made


  Having difficult conversations in the workplace can be emotionally charged. This makes it difficult to communicate well. It is easier to convey and receive messages when calm and confident.


  Additionally, when there is conflict, we often make assumptions about why it is happening and the intentions of the others involved. Learning to take a step back and prepare for these times is essential to your success in the workplace.


  Sometimes, avoiding difficult conversations is the best route. We think we can ignore the inappropriate banter of colleagues. We make excuses for why someone else got the new position we felt we deserved. It feels easier to ignore the conflicts with others on our team. Wrong! These problems will continue to cause challenges if you avoid having a difficult conversation.
