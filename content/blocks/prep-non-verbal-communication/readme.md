introduction: >-
  Non-verbal communication is just as important as verbal communication. If we
  match non-verbal with verbal we can reinforce our words or vice versa.
  Non-verbal communication helps us spot if someone is being untruthful with us.




  It is good to be aware of how non-verbal communication differs from culture to culture. Certain gestures can have different meanings depending on who you are talking to. For example a ‘thumbs up’ means ‘good job or well done’ in Europe or America but in the Middle East it can mean ‘up yours’. In Western cultures, eye contact is a sign of interest and confidence, and doing otherwise gives the impression of disinterest. Whereas in many Middle Eastern countries eye contact between sexes is inappropriate and in many Asian areas it can be a sign of confrontation and aggression. These are just two differences among many, so keep those in mind when communicating with people from different backgrounds to yours.
