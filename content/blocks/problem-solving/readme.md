      **IDEA** is a simple yet effective four-step problem-solving process to
      identify the problem, develop solutions, execute a plan and then assess
      your results.


      **I**: Identify the problem


      **D**: develop solutions


      **E**: execute your plan


      **A**: assess the extent to which the plan resolved the problem


      ﻿Form groups of 4 or 5 people, with different people. Read the following problem and follow the steps below.


      “Our oceans are full of plastic waste. A lot of them are eaten by fish. This causes uncertain effects on our health. According to The Economist newspaper, by 2050, the oceans could contain more plastic than fish, measured in weight. So: **How can we reduce the plastic waste in our oceans today?”**


      1. **Identify** and understand the problem you are trying to solve. Is the oceans being polluted the symptom or consequence? What is the root cause? Ask “Why?” as often as necessary until you get to the bottom of the issue.


      2. Brainstorm to come up with a few possible solutions. Determine the Pros and Cons for each of them until everyone agrees on which one would be the most appropriate. Once you have determined the solution, come up with goals that we can execute and will help us solve the problem.


      3. Discuss how the goals you set in the previous step can be executed. If one of your goals was to remove 10% of plastic waste in our oceans in 1 year, you must explain how you will accomplish this goal.


      4. The final step is to **assess** if the solution addresses the problem. We won’t be able to solve the problem in 30 minutes, but instead, identify the ways you could monitor and assess progress on solving the problem on an ongoing basis.
