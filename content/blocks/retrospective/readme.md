      1. Open the chosen board.

      2. Give everyone 5-10 minutes to add their examples. Make sure you use 1 post-it/ticket per example.

      3. Start reviewing the examples. 

         * Usually, we start with the positive ones first.
         * Ask the person who wrote the example to give more input to the group
         * Open it up for questions and detailing
      4. Agree on an action for that example, if applicable. 

         * Write the action on the board 
         * Define who in the team will be responsible for delivering it
         * Agree on a deadline.
