  Reflect upon your own experiences. What is an example of a time when you took a fixed mindset? Ask yourself the following questions:


  * What was the scenario? What events took place?Â 

  * Why did you have a fixed mindset? What characteristics did you display?

  * What negative effects did your mindset have on you?

  * What would have the outcome been if you had adopted the growth mindset? What benefits would you have experienced?


  Imagine you were to mentor your past self. How would you advise yourself in that moment to have a growth mindset? Make bullet points as detailed as possible.
