    content: When building good software, it is important to consider your users and
      design your solution to have as good a user experience as possible, no
      matter who they are. Read this [article about product accessibility and
      inclusion](https://uxdesign.cc/inclusion-first-how-to-make-your-product-accessible-and-inclusive-b8ccbeb24b22).  Afterwards,
      think about your most recent code and identify three or four things that
      you could change to improve its accessibility for different user
      communities.
