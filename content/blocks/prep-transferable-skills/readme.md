  Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAZLU2aYzcY).


  Feedback is a valuable tool to understand whether things are going in the right direction or not. It is also an effective way to help people develop and grow professionally. How feedback is communicated will not only determine how effective it will be but also how positive its impact will be. Do your own research about the definition and different types of feedback. Answer the following questions in writing:


  * What is feedback?

  * What is general feedback and specific feedback?

  * What is positive feedback?

  * What is negative feedback?

  * What is constructive feedback?

  * What is destructive feedback?

  * Why is it important to receive and give feedback effectively?


  2. Go through [this slides deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E8O9eh8dTQdIsI6VpVwFHesAz0PBDW38WSXuTir_vUk/edit#slide=id.ga9333c68a9_0_33) about the transferable skills. Write a 100-word text on your previous job/education experience and demonstrate how these can be transferred to the skills needed as a developer. Share it with your pair of the week so you can discuss it in the class.
