      ##### Situation 1: Tom asked Katie for help on the code he was writing.


      * Tom: “Hi Katie, would you mind spending a few minutes looking at this function I am working on? I can’t seem to find what’s wrong with the code.”

      * Katie: “I am extremely busy and stressed with a deadline, but let me have a look.”

      * Tom: “Here is the function. Do you see anything wrong with it?”

      * Katie: (after looking at the code for some time) “Seriously? How could you miss this? You are missing an End statement. You need to be more careful when writing code so you only ask for help for things that are not this obvious.”

      * Katie walks away.


      ##### Situation 2: Patricia stops by Carla’s desk.


      * Patricia: “Hi Carla. Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate the work you did in the last project and I hope we get to work together again”

      * Carla: “Oh Thank You! You made my day!”


      ##### Situation 3: Team members in a project retrospective meeting discuss things they did well and things that need improvement.


      * Jessica: “I think overall the project went well but developers were constantly waiting for Karen to finish testing their code before they could deploy to Production. She was overwhelmed with the amount of work on her plate”

      * Karen: “Yes, I felt bad for blocking deployments but I cannot give my approval until I have completed testing the code.”

      * Jessica: “Did you ask for help? We can have developers take the role of QA tester when you are overwhelmed.”

      * Karen: “No, I did not ask for help. I did not think of this as an option. I will start implementing this strategy going forward”
