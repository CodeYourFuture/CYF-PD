title: Public Speaking / Circles of Influence
description: In this session, you will practice speaking confidently to your
  peers. You will also further develop the Circles of Influence you created in
  the prep work.
modules: JS2
week: "4"
skills:
  - Confidence
  - Communication
objectives:
  - Speak with confidence about a very familiar topic to a group of peers
time: 60
prep: You will need the Circles of Influence you created as part of the prep work
introduction: >-
  Everyone will be expected in their careers to present topics to
  different-sized groups and different types of audiences. The only way to
  become more confident and effective at doing these presentations is to
  practice. In this session, you will experiment with Power Poses, which some
  people find gives them a boost of confidence. Let's give it a try and you
  might feel it helps you.


  Following this, you will practice giving a short talk about the topic you prepared to a friendly group of your peers.


  In addition, you will develop the Circles of Influence you created in the prep to improve your ability to affect aspects of your life and worry less about things you cannot control.
exercises:
  - name: Power Poses
    time: 10
    goal: Use Power Poses to give yourself a confidence boost
    content: >-
      Some psychologists have suggested that doing “Power Poses” for two minutes
      before a stressful event - like a presentation or a job interview - can
      help you boost your confidence and, therefore, help you perform better. 
      (Don’t do power poses *during* an interview! You’ll appear arrogant.)


      This isn't 100% scientifically proven, but many people to feel this exercise helps them, so let's see if you can benefit from it.


      Possible Power Poses are:


      * “**Victory**” - Arms up in a V shape

      * “**Wonder Woman**” - legs apart, hands on hips, head high

      * “**Obama**” - sitting down with feet up on the table and hands behind head

      * “**Salutation**” - feel firmly planted, chest out, arms stretched wide

      * “**Superman**” - one arm ahead, fist clenched, ‘flying’ through the air


      In contrast, low-power poses are those where you make yourself small, protecting yourself with your hands and arms. Avoid these.


      Steps:


      1. Choose someone to be the timekeeper (preferably a volunteer)

      2. Spread out in the room, giving yourself plenty of space

      3. Everyone chooses one of the Power Pose and holds it for 30 seconds. Be BIG. 

      4. Repeat THREE times with a different pose each time

      How do you feel compared with how you felt at the beginning of this exercise?
  - name: Public Speaking
    time: 30
    goal: Practice your public speaking in your groups
    content: >-
      Split into roughly equal groups of about 8 to 10 people. Take turns to be
      the speaker and give the three-minute talk you prepared to the other group
      members.  


      Listeners, practice your active listening skills (give full attention to the speaker, reflect in your body language, nod, smile, and look puzzled as appropriate). At the end of each talk, each give the speaker **ONE positive feedback** about their talk.
  - name: Circles of Influence Discussion
    time: 15
    goal: "Discuss the Circles of Influence you created as prep, focus on changes
      you can make to waste less energy/worry on things you cannot affect and
      more on things you can control or influence. "
    content: >-
      Find a partner, and in your pairs, take turns to answer the following
      questions about your Circles of Influence (**5 minutes each**)


      1. Looking at some of the items in your outer Circle of Concern, 

         * What could you do to move them into your circle of influence? 
         * What could you do about them that is within your control? 
         * Which ones can you do nothing about? Practice accepting that you can’t do anything about them and shift your focus and energy to the things you can influence and control. 
      2. Looking at some of the items in your Circle of Influence,

         * Can you break any of these down into smaller things you can control?

      As a whole group, spend **5 minutes sharing your learnings from this exercise**. Were there any interesting ideas that you had to worry less about some concerns or changes you might make to gain greater control or influence?


      *The more you focus on and operate within your circles of influence and control, the bigger these circles will become. You are becoming more proactive and developing a growth mindset.*
  - name: Create groups for JS3
    time: 5
    goal: Create groups for the next module's group work
    content: >-
      Interacting with diverse groups fosters empathy, enhancing interpersonal
      skills for handling others effectively. So, focus on grouping with people
      you might not have interacted with so much.


      At least two people must define the groups together. You must consider trainees’ availability. You must also consider how many hours of coursework or prep work must be done in groups.


      1. Define the groups for the next module. Look for diversity, so people that haven't worked together should give it a go, ensure you don't have gendered groups, etc…   Don't forget to check availability again.

         Tip: You can use this [link](https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator) to help you allocate people randomly
      2. Open the existing spreadsheet for pairs/groups, create a new tab called "JS3 Groups”, and add the groups to the "JS3 Groups" tab

      3. Share the spreadsheet on Slack, so it is visible to everyone
