      The following are the roles typically found within a development team. As

      Discuss **as a class** the **responsibilities** of the following tech roles. 


      Write a **brief description** for each of them on a post-it and share the post it on a collaborative board:


      * Front-end web developer

    content: >-
      You might come across a ceremony called “**team charter**” in your future

      Team charters define **roles, responsibilities and ways of working**. If these are not clear to you when you join a new company, you should ask and seek clarification urgently.


      Discuss as a class:


      * Why is it important for your team to understand their main goal?

      * Why is it important for everybody on your team to understand the role each other plays?

      * What is the importance of having clear ways of working?

      * What happens when you are not clear about these three points?


      Spend the rest of your time clarifying any questions about the project and the coursework for the first week.
