  Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAZLU2aYzcY).


  Feedback is a valuable tool to understand whether things are going in the right direction or not. It is also an effective way to help people develop and grow professionally. How feedback is communicated will not only determine how effective it will be but also how positive its impact will be. Do your own research about the definition and different types of feedback. Answer the following questions in writing:


  * What is feedback?

  * What is general feedback and specific feedback?

  * What is positive feedback?

  * What is negative feedback?

  * What is constructive feedback?

  * What is destructive feedback?

  * Why is it important to receive and give feedback effectively?


  2. Go through [this slides deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E8O9eh8dTQdIsI6VpVwFHesAz0PBDW38WSXuTir_vUk/edit#slide=id.ga9333c68a9_0_33) about the transferable skills. Write a 100-word text on your previous job/education experience and demonstrate how these can be transferred to the skills needed as a developer. Share it with your pair of the week so you can discuss it in the class.
introduction: In this session we will talk about our transferable skills. We
  will give each other feedback on the document we prepared before the session.
exercises:
  - name: Brainstorming about transferable skills
    time: 10
    goal: To brainstorm about transferable skills.
    content: >-
      You prepared a short text listing the skills you have acquired in your
      previous education and jobs, and discussing how these can be transferred
      to the skills you will need as a developer.


      Come together with your pair of the week, read each others texts and discuss. You can ask each other the following questions:


      * What would your strengths be as a professional?

      * How did your skills help you achieve your goals in your previous education/job?

      * What skills do you use to adapt new situations?

      * What skills do you use during this bootcamp?

    time: 15
    goal: To explore positive and negative feedback.

      Work with your pair. Take turns to play the roles below and answer the
      following questions for each situation:


      * Was feedback positive or negative?

      * Was the way it was communicated appropriate? Why?

      * How would you improve it?

      * What would your reaction be after receiving such feedback?

      * Were people in the right mindset to give and receive feedback?




      *Situation 1:* Tom asked Katie for help on the code he was writing. 


      Tom: “Hi Katie, would you mind spending a few minutes looking at this function I am working on? I can’t seem to find what’s wrong with the code.”


      Katie: “I am extremely busy and stressed with a deadline, but let me have a look.”


      Tom: “Here is the function. Do you see anything wrong with it?”


      Katie: (after looking at the code for some time) “Seriously? How could you miss this? You are missing an End statement. You need to be more careful when writing code so you only ask for help for things that are not this obvious.”


      Katie walks away.


      *Situation 2:* Patricia stops by Carla’s desk.


      Patricia: “Hi Carla. Just wanted to let you know how much I appreciate the work you did in the last project and I hope we get to work together again”


      Carla: “Oh Thank You! You made my day!”


      *Situation 3:* Team members in a project retrospective meeting discuss things they did well and things that need improvement.


      Jessica: “I think overall the project went well but developers were constantly waiting for Karen to finish testing their code before they could deploy to Production. She was overwhelmed with the amount of work on her plate”


      Karen: “Yes, I felt bad for blocking deployments but I cannot give my approval until I have completed testing the code.”


      Jessica: “Did you ask for help? We can have developers take the role of QA tester when you are overwhelmed.”


      Karen: “No, I did not ask for help. I did not think of this as an option. I will start implementing this strategy going forward”
