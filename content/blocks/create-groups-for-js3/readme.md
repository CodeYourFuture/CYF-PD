    content: >-
      At least two people must define the groups together.  You must consider
      trainees’ availability.  You must also consider how many hours of
      coursework or prep work has to be done in groups.


      1. Define the groups for the next module.  Look for diversity, so people that haven't worked together should give it a go, ensure you don't have gendered groups, etc…  Tip: You can use this [link](https://www.randomlists.com/team-generator) to help you allocate people randomly

      2. Open the existing spreadsheet for pairs/groups and create a new tab called "JS3 Groups”, and add the groups to the "JS3 Groups" tab

      3. Share the spreadsheet on Slack so it is visible to everyone
