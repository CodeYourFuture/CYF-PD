      Which five of the following ideas do you think are the most important when answering good questions?


      * If they’re not asking clearly, helping them clarify

      * Figuring out what they know already

      * Pointing them to the documentation

      * Pointing them to a useful search

      * Writing new documentation

      * Explaining what you did

      * Solving the underlying problem

      * Asking “Did that answer your question?”

      * Not acting surprised

      * Letting them know what you level you expect them to be at.

      * Asking what steps they have taken to solve the question themselves.

    goal: "To think of technical questions that you will improve during the session "
    content: Think of three examples of technical problems that you have recently
      had. These could either be from JavaScript, HTML, CSS or any other
      technical area.  For example, they could be about error messages you
      didn’t expect or understand, or about code that didn’t work as you
      expected, or about webpages that didn’t get rendered as you anticipated.
      You’ll need these questions as you will work on them to structure them
      into good questions that are likely to get valuable responses on Saturday.
