  The demo is done to the product team and various stakeholders. In our case, it
  will be to your cohort and all volunteers. 


  We expect you to watch all other demos and ask questions or give feedback. 


  The demo aims to maintain transparency, enable faster troubleshooting, and encourage accountability for quality code. Ultimately, it stimulates collaboration, knowledge sharing and continuous improvement. 


  These small ceremonies build empathy, align priorities, provide teaching moments, and support a culture where shipping features responsibly earn praise.

      Your demo should be no longer than 5 minutes. This means you need to be
      clear and concise on the slides. Here are some tips for your presentation:


      1. Focus on 1 key message. Stick to your point. 


      2. Avoid text-heavy slides. Instead, use visuals.


      3. Share stories or examples to ensure understanding.  


      4. Practice extensively to deliver it within a tight timeframe.


      5. Summarize critical information at both the opening and closing. End strong.


      The demo agenda should include the following:


      * What you've done this week

      * Demoing your product, which can be UI/UX designs or a live walkthrough of your product

      * What you are planning to do next
