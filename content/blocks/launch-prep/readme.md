  development competencies: communication, teamwork, problem-solving, time
  management and confidence. So make sure you go through the points you know you
  might need an extra reminder for and read them.


  But to get you and your team ready for The Launch, there are other things you need to do, too, and this prep work will walk you through them.


  Get ready to Launch your career!
exercises:
  - name: Your Team
    time: 60
    goal: Define your team rules
    content: >-
      Working in teams is one of the hardest things in our professional lives.
      That is because we are all different and have our opinions, values, and
      knowledge. Knowing how to work and respect each other is key to being a
      successful professional in tech.


      This exercise will explain your team formation and give tips on what you should define from the start to reduce conflicts. 


      Your team will have:


      * 3 or 4 Developers: these will be other trainees you might know.

      * 1 [Tech Lead](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/teams-1/cyf-products-final-projects/roles/tech-lead): a volunteer who will support your team with the architecture and design of your product

      * 1. [Product Manager](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/teams-1/cyf-products-final-projects/roles/product-manager): a volunteer who will work with you to detail the scope and define the user stories


      You might also have the following members if a trainee focuses on this career.


      * QA (Tester)

      * [UI/UX Designer](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/teams-1/cyf-products-final-projects/roles/ui-ux-designer)


      You might have a [Business Owner](https://docs.codeyourfuture.io/volunteers/teams-1/cyf-products-final-projects/roles/business-owner-final-projects) representing the charity or organisation you are doing this briefing for. They will give your team insight into the users' needs and the value the product will deliver.




      **What do you need to do?**


      Arrange a team meeting to go through the following agenda. You can use Exercises 1 and 2 of this [Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM-LblbI=/). (Exercise 3 is for the class)


      1. **Clarify roles and responsibilities**: review the roles and ensure everyone on the team understands what they are doing and how they will contribute.

      2. **Get to know each other**: everyone should say 1 thing/action they like and one they don’t like so that you get to know each other's ways of working. For example, I ***do not like*** having meetings early in the morning because it is my focus time. I ***like*** meetings to have a clear agenda so I can prepare beforehand.

      3. **Write a team agreement:** you will all respect these rules as a team. For example, I will let the team know if I cannot make a meeting.; I will prepare for the meetings beforehand.; I will commit my code to production whenever it has been approved and tested

      4. **Define your team's name**: you can just be called Team 3, but if you want to create an identity, you have all the freedom. Or it could be the name of the organisation the briefing is for. 

      5. **Create your Slack channel** and add the relevant participants.
