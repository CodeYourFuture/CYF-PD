introduction: >-
  Working as a team when developing software is very important. The
  collaboration, knowledge sharing and diversity of skill sets result in
  higher-quality products, faster development cycles, and a more efficient
  workflow. This delivers success in meeting customer needs and achieving
  project goals.


  During the JS3 module, you will prepare a **Teamwork Project**. You will be assigned to a team by the volunteers. You will work as a team on a **fictional digital product for a fictional client**. You are not going to do any coding. This project aims to improve your teamwork skills. You will learn how to get prepared for a product before the software development phase.


  You will:


  * Week 1: Decide how you are going to work as a team

  * Week 2: Define the minimum viable product for your project

  * Week 3: Define features and user stories for your product

  * Week 4: Present a brief for your product and your teamwork


  Each team member should:


  * Organise and attend calls

  * Have clear responsibilities

  * Help each other when needed
