introduction: Helping others is a foundational value at CYF. This week you will
  explore what helping each other means in the CYF community. Let’s start with
  exploring why helping others makes you happier.
exercises:
  - name: Helpers high
    time: 15
    goal: To understand helpers high and why it's important to help
    content: >-
      Think about a time when you helped someone and felt a ‘helper’s high’ and
      also about a time when you helped someone and did not experience an
      increase of positive emotion.


      Based on your two examples, in what way do you think you like helping others? For example, is it through giving your time, or does it make you happy when you can give someone some money or advice, etc. 


      * Write 2-3 sentences regarding this and share in a thread on Slack. One person can start the thread - if no one has started it yet, be the first one.
