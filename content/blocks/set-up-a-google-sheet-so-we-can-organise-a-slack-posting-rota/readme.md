      One trainee will set up a Google sheet on the cohort drive


      * The title of the spreadsheet should be **XXX Rota** (substitute XXXX for the region initials and cohort number, for example, GLA 6)

      * Save the file on the cohort drive

      * The name of the tab should be "Slack Rota"

      *  The  first tab must have at least the columns Date and Name

      * A﻿dd all the dates for the Fundamentals course months

      * Post a message on the cohort Slack with the shared spreadsheet and the instructions on what to do (see below)


      **I﻿nstructions**


      * Go to the tab Slack rota and add your name against one date.

      * Be carefule not to overwrite if someone else is adding their name.

      * Once you have done so, add a "Done" emoji on this post. You should have the same number of emojis added as trainees in your cohort.

      * If you know people who haven't added their names yet, tag them in this thread to remind them.

      * This file will be the rota of that person's daily messages posted on Slack. You have more information about it in your Coursework.
