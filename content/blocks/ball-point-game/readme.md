title: Ball Point Game
description: The Ball Point game brings to life several aspects of working in an
  agile way. Teams invent a process to ‘deliver’ balls and then improve these
  processes over the course of several sprints.
modules: JS2
week: "4"
skills:
  - Time/Project Management
objectives:
  - Describe how short sprints combined with timely feedback can benefit team
    operations
time: 60
prep: >-
  Form into approximately equal-sized teams of between five and ten people each.


  Choose ONE of the TWO exercises.  


  Exercise 1a - Ball Point game with balls (recommended)


  * Each team needs a bag with at least 20 balls and another empty bag 

  * One person is nominated as The Timekeeper with a flipchart and pens


  Exercise 1b - Online Ball Point game (same learning objectives, and requires no balls)


  * Everyone needs a laptop

  * One person *from each team* is nominated as The Timekeeper

  * The website <https://remoteballpointgame.openforce.com/> is up and available
introduction: The aim of the game (either option) is for teams to invent a
  process by which balls are passed between players as quickly as possible and
  with as few defects as possible in order to score points.

      The Rules:


      * A point is scored when **every player in a team touches a ball**

      * **If a ball falls** on the ground, **it counts as a defect** and cannot be used in the current round 

      * You cannot pass a ball directly to your immediate neighbour

      * Balls must have “**air-time**” (a ball may only be touched by one person at a time)


      The Flow:


      * **Preparation** (planning and retrospective): all team members invent or improve the process together (2 minutes)

      * **Estimation**: the team estimates how many points they will score in the next round (a few seconds)

      * **Play** (sprint): the team uses its process to score points (2 minutes)


      The Timekeeper will create a table for each team as below.  The Timekeeper will also announce when to move between the different phases and record each team's estimates, actuals and defects.


      | **Sprint** | **Estimate** | **Actual** | **Defects** |

      | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |

      | **1**      | *20*         | *15*       | *3*         |

      | **2**      | *30*         | *20*       | *0*         |

      | **3**      | ...          | ...        | ...         |

      | **4**      | ...          | ...        | ...         |

      | **5**      | ...          | ...        | ...         |


      In your teams, you will perform FIVE sprints, and since each sprint will take less than 5 minutes, the whole game will take under 30 minutes.

      Each team decides on a case-sensitive team name and everyone on the team
      uses this to open the online game.  E.g. if the team name is
      “WM6-MangoTeam”, the game URL will be
      <https://remoteballpointgame.openforce.com/WM6-MangoTeam>


      Each team member needs to:


      * Set their name

      * Choose which controls to use: mouse & keyboard, or keyboard only

      * Pick an avatar 

      * Press F at any time to see the flip chart which explains the controls for mouse or keyboard, the warm-up rules, the Ball Point rules and the scoreboard for each sprint (use the arrow buttons to move between these)

      * The Timekeeper can press T to start or reset the two-minute timer


      Tip: you can change your controls, name or avatar at any time by refreshing the URL.


      **Warm-up game**


      Get familiar with the controls by picking up a ball (left/right mouse click or spacebar/shift key) and passing it to someone else in the same room.  


      When everyone on the team is used to the controls, you are ready to move on to the actual game.


      **Ball Point game**


      The Rules:


      * A point is scored when **every player in a team** **touches a ball**

      * **If a ball falls** on the ground, **it counts as a defect** and cannot be used in the current round 


      The Flow: 


      * **Preparation** (retrospective and planning): all team members invent or improve the process together (2 minutes).  

      * **Estimation**: the team estimates how many points they will score in the next round and the Timekeeper records this (a few seconds)

      * **Play** (sprint): the team uses its process to score points (2 minutes)


      The Timekeeper can press T to start/reset the two minute timer for the preparation and play phases.  The Timekeeper should also record estimates, actuals and defects for each round by pressing F and the left/right arrows to get to the scorecard.


      | **Sprint** | **Estimate** | **Actual** | **Defects** |

      | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- | ----------- |

      | **1**      | *20*         | *15*       | *3*         |

      | **2**      | *30*         | *20*       | *0*         |

      | **3**      | ...          | ...        | ...         |

      | **4**      | ...          | ...        | ...         |

      | **5**      | ...          | ...        | ...         |


      In your teams, you will perform FIVE sprints, and since each sprint will take less than 5 minutes, the whole game will take under 30 minutes.

      rapid feedback and to consider how this relates to working in a real
      software development team.

      As a *whole group*, reflect on the following questions:


      1. What did you experience during the Ball Point Game?

      2. What do you notice about your scores?  Your defects?  Your estimate accuracy?

      3. How much did you “fail”?

      4. How did you go about deciding improvements from round to round?

      5. Would you have scored more points if you had initially planned longer?

      6. Would you have scored more points if you had made one plan and then played one long round? (Why not?)

      7. Would you have scored more points if one individual had decided the process? (Why not?)

      8. How is this related to your daily work?
