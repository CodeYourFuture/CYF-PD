      1. The facilitator will shuffle the deck of cards. When doing so, they should make sure to prep the cards according to the size of the cohort to ensure there is an equal amount of each suit (hearts, clubs, diamonds, and spades).



      2. No speaking is allowed during this exercise.



      3. Each trainee gets one card and DOES NOT share which one it is with anyone.




      4. Trainees should group based on their suit (spades, clubs, hearts, and diamonds) without talking to each other.




      5. Once in their groups, they have to line up according to the rank of the card (ace, king, queen, jack, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three and two) using non-verbal communication.

      6. You have 20 minutes so make sure you try your best to get to the end of the game. 


       


      7. At the end of the game, take 5 minutes to discuss how you communicated and what kind of non-verbal communication you used.




      **ONLINE VERSION CHANGES***


      1. Facilitator will let trainees know which card they got through a message.

      2. Once trainees are in groups according to their suit, they go into different breakout rooms.




      3. The rest of the instructions remain as they are. 




      \*might take a bit longer, so the facilitator should prepare before starting.
