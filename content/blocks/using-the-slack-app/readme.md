  It's important because it enhances productivity, fosters collaboration, and centralises communication for remote and distributed teams.
exercises:
  - name: Let's share our knowledge about Slack
    time: 15
    goal: Identify who is already Slack savvy and could support the other trainees
      in their learning journey
    content: >-
      Trainees should discuss the below questions about Slack and how to use it,
      to share their knowledge with others


      * What is a thread? 

      * How do we find a certain channel? 

      * Where do we look for notifications?

      * How can I turn off notifications so I am not overwhelmed?

      * Why is it important to react to a channel/message/thread?

      * Why do we need to check Slack on a daily basis?

      * Why should I avoid long texts and use short titles/paragraph with details in thread? 

      * Why should we avoid using private messaging?
  - name: Let's practice using a thread
    time: 10
    goal: Everyone to actively using Slack and replying in a thread
    content: >-
      * O﻿ne trainee posts something on the cohort Slack (for example, do you
      like Slack? or What is your favourite colour?)

      * Every trainee must reply to it - this exercise only finished is we have the number of replies equals the number of trainees in the class!
  - name: Emojis express a lot
    time: 10
    goal: Understand the emojis meaning
    content: >-
      In pairs play the Emoji communication game. 


      * One person writes a message only using emojis on the cohort channel and tags their pair

      * The other person tries to understand it and writes the answer in the thread

      * Continue the conversation in the thread until it makes sense.

      * Then they switch roles - the person who was answering the message writes a new message on that thread and tags their pair

      * And repeat
  - name: Let's practice reacting to a message with an emoji
    time: 10
    goal: Ensure we have clearly understood how to use emojis
    content: >-
      A trainee posts something on the channel


      E﻿very trainee reacts to it with what they think is the appropriate emoji.


      Discuss if anyone doesn't understand or wants to know more about a specific emoji that was used.
