week: "2"

  - By the end of this session trainees will know how to use Slack as a
    communication tool
time: 45

introduction: >-
  Slack is a collaboration platform that enables efficient team communication,
  file sharing, and integration with various tools.


  It's important because it enhances productivity, fosters collaboration, and centralises communication for remote and distributed teams.
exercises:
  - name: Let's share our knowledge about Slack
    time: 15
    goal: Share your knowledge about Slack
    content: >-
      Trainees should discuss the below questions about Slack and how to use it
      to share their knowledge with others.


      * What is a thread? 

      * How do we find a particular channel? 

      * Where do we look for notifications?

      * How can I turn off notifications so I am not overwhelmed?

      * Why is it important to react to a channel/message/thread?

      * Why do we need to check Slack daily?

      * Why should I avoid long texts and use short titles/paragraph with details in a thread? 

      * Why should we avoid using private messaging?
  - name: Let's practice using a thread
    time: 10
    goal: For everyone to actively use Slack and reply in a thread
    content: >-
      * O﻿ne trainee posts something on the cohort Slack (for example, do you
      like Slack? or What is your favourite colour?)

      * Every trainee must reply to it - this exercise only finishes if we have the same number of replies as the number of trainees in the class!
  - name: Emojis express a lot
    time: 10
    goal: Understand the meaning of emojis
    content: >-
      In pairs, play the Emoji communication game. 


      * One person writes a message only using emojis on the cohort channel and tags their pair.

      * The other person tries to understand it and writes the answer in the thread.

      * Continue the conversation in the thread until it makes sense.

      * Then they switch roles - the person answering the message writes a new message on that thread and tags their pair.

      * And repeat
  - name: Let's practice reacting to a message with an emoji
    time: 10
    goal: Ensure we have clearly understood how to use emojis
    content: >-
      A trainee posts something on the channel


      E﻿very trainee reacts to it with what they think is the appropriate emoji.


      Discuss if anyone doesn't understand or wants to know more about a specific emoji used.
