  Slack is a collaboration platform that enables efficient team communication,
  file sharing, and integration with various tools.


  It's important because it enhances productivity, fosters collaboration, and centralises communication for remote and distributed teams.
exercises:
  - name: Let's share our knowledge about Slack
    time: 10
    goal: Share your knowledge about Slack
    content: >-
      Trainees should discuss the below questions about Slack and how to use it
      to share their knowledge with others.


      * What is a thread? 

      * How do we find a particular channel? 

      * Where do we look for notifications?

      * How can I turn off notifications so I am not overwhelmed?

      * Why is it important to react to a channel/message/thread?

      * Why do we need to check Slack daily?

      * Why should I avoid long texts and use short titles/paragraph with details in a thread? 

      * Why should we avoid using private messaging?
  - name: Let's practice using a thread
    time: 10
    goal: For everyone to actively use Slack and reply in a thread
    content: >-
      * O﻿ne trainee posts something on the cohort Slack (for example, do you
      like Slack? or What is your favourite colour?)

      * Every trainee must reply to it - this exercise only finishes if we have the same number of replies as the number of trainees in the class!
  - name: Organising the cohort thread
    time: 10
    goal: Organisation of tasks whilst using Slack
    content: >-
      Someone should post a question on Slack: "What would you do if you come to
      a class and there are no volunteers to guide it? How would you organise
      yourselves?".


      1. Add on the thread one suggestion of what could be do

      2. React with a pertinent emoji to the suggestions you think should be adopted

      3. React with an emoji showing the suggestions you think should **not** be adopted
