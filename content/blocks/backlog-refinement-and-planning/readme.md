title: Backlog Refinement and Planning
description: To ensure the team is all on the same page the planning and/or
  backlog refinement session are key.
modules: Portfolio
week: "2"
skills:
  - Time/Project Management
  - Teamwork
objectives:
  - Refine tickets' acceptance criteria
time: 58
introduction: >-
  The backlog refinement is about reviewing the tickets you have that should be
  picked up next - and ensuring they are the next priority.


  When planning your next iteration, you will decide which tickets do we aim to deliver by the following in-person session. We can also discuss which ones you want to demo.
exercises:
  - name: Refine your tickets
    time: 25
    goal: Have enough tickets refined for 1.5 weeks
    content: >-
      During this review, the team will work together:


      1. Discuss as an overview the tickets that will be reviewed and why. Make sure you all agree they are the next priority.


      2. Open the highest priority ticket and read it quietly to remind yourself what this ticket is about.


      3. Discuss the acceptance criteria. Have we forgotten anything? Have we covered the unhappy scenarios? Do we know how we will test (or build our tests - TDD? ;) ) 


      4. Everyone must agree that each team member is happy with the ticket and can pick it up next and work on it. The ticket is now considered as "Ready for Development".
  - name: Plan your delivery
    time: 20
    goal: "Prioritise which tickets we can deliver in the next 1 week "
    content: >-
      We now might have more tickets Ready for Development than we can actually
      deliver. So we need to decide which tickets will we agree on delivering in
      the next week and work as a team to achieve this.


      1. Discuss if anyone will not be available in the coming week or have a reduced availability


      2. Discuss the size/difficulty of the tickets


      3. Considering the above, decide which tickets you believe you can deliver in the coming week.


      4. Identify which ticket you will want to demo next week.
