title: Teamwork Project S3
description: This session will explore how to detail the features you listed
  during prep work and then create create features user stories and tasks for
  your product.
modules: JS3
week: "3"
skills:
  - Teamwork
objectives:
  - Identify features for a product
  - Write user stories for a product
  - Explain the importance of reading and understanding the acceptance criteria
time: 60
prep: " Post-its and a collaborative board."
introduction: >-
  When mapping a product, we go from the high to the lowest level to plan our
  delivery. The reason for that is so that the team and stakeholders all have
  the same knowledge of the strategy of the product and the main end goal.


  H﻿owever, we cannot deliver everything at once. And we also cannot plan every detail. We can prioritise the must-haves and then focus on them.


  > P﻿roduct > Features > User Stories > Acceptance criteria > Tasks
exercises:
  - goal: To understand the requirements of building a library website.
    name: What questions should we ask to identify what needs to be built?
    time: 5
    content: >-
      Let’s assume we have been asked to build a library website that allows you
      to borrow books. 


      * Discuss **briefly** as a class **what questions we should ask** to understand better what we will build.  

      * Write these questions on post-its and share them on the collaborative board. 


      *Make sure to encourage different people to share their ideas*


      *F﻿ocus is on the questions, not the answers!*
  - goal: To understand the process of breaking down a product into features.
    time: 10
    content: >-
      Let’s assume we got answers to all our questions about the product. *(We
      are not going to actually answer them)*


      Overall, the goal is to build a website with a catalogue of books that can be borrowed online.


      * In small groups, identify the main features you would expect to see on this website. *In this example, features could be a shopping cart, book search, etc.*

      * O﻿ne person of each group to share the group's thoughts with the class.
    name: What features should this website have?
  - goal: To understand the process of breaking down features into user stories.
    name: Breaking features down into user stories
    time: 15
    content: >-
      Now that we have all the features, we need to break them down into user
      stories.


      In small groups, **pick one of the features** and break it down into at least **2 user stories**. For example, for the shopping cart feature the user stories could be:


      * **As a** library user, I **want** to be able to remove items I have included in my shopping cart **so that** when I checkout the remaining books are the ones I want to borrow. 

      * **As a** library user, **I want** to be able to pay with credit card for the books in my shopping cart **so they** can be delivered to me


      Different group representatives volunteer to share thoughts with the class.
  - goal: To understand the process of breaking down user stories into tasks and
      distributing those tasks among team members.
    name: Tasks needed to deliver this user story
    time: 15
    content: >-
      Now that we have user stories, it is time to **break them down into
      tasks**. Tasks are used to break down user stories into smaller components
      that can then be assigned to individual team members. 


      C﻿hose a user story and in t﻿he same groups complete the following:


      * Identify the tasks that need to be completed in order to deliver value to the user, providing the outcome described in the user story.

      * Identify relationships and dependencies between tasks.

        *  How does a change in Task A affect other tasks? 
        * Does Task A need to be completed before we can work on Task B?
      * Size those tasks taking into account complexity and dependencies.

      * Answer these questions: when is it the right time to assign tasks to team members, what would be the criteria you would follow when assigning tasks?


      Examples of tasks for a user story describing the book search functionality could be Search Box, Text Autocomplete, Database creation and setup. Discuss in small groups. 


      Again, a different group representative volunteer to share thoughts with the class.
