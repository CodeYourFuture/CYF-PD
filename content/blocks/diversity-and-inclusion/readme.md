      experiences of feeling included or excluded in a group. Try to remember
      how that experience made you feel and how you dealt with it. Did someone
      help you? Did you help someone be included in a group?

      Diversity and inclusion in your team or working with stakeholders is
      important. However, it is also very important when building a product and
      making it easily usable by as wide a user community as possible.


      Work in small groups. Imagine that your group will develop a new tech product. Consider the following questions:


      1. How can you make sure that the product is as inclusive and accessible as possible?

      2. What challenges can you experience when designing an inclusive and accessible product?

      3. What essential accessibility requirements should you take into consideration?

      4. What should you consider to ensure all team members feel included?

         Prepare a pitch for your product. Name a speaker for your group. They will share your pitch and explain how you will create an inclusive and accessible product. Groups will have a maximum of 2 minutes to present their pitch.

         Ask someone to be the timekeeper, so we donâ€™t overrun our schedule.
