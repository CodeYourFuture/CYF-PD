      Discuss in small groups for 10 minutes. Reflect on your personal
      experiences of feeling included or excluded in a group. Try to remember
      how that experience made you feel and how you dealt with it. Did someone
      help you? Did you help someone be included in a group?

      Diversity and inclusion in your team or working with stakeholders is
      important. However, it is also very important when building a product.



      Work in small groups. Imagine that your group will develop a new tech product. Consider following questions:




      1. How can you make sure that the product is as inclusive as possible?

      2. What challenges can you experience when designing an inclusive product?

      3. What challenges can you experience when developing an inclusive product?

      4. What essential accessibility requirements should you take into consideration?

      5. What should you consider to ensure all team members are feeling included?

         Prepare a pitch for your product. Name a speaker for your group. They will share your pitch and explain how you are going to create an inclusive product. Groups will have maximum 2 minutes to present their pitch.

         Ask someone to be the time keeper, so we donâ€™t overrun our schedule.
