      The following themes are the ones that should be discussed. They are
      guidelines in a suggested order, but you can choose the one you want to
      discuss each week.


      Ideally, these should be worked on in smaller groups with a broader group reflection.


      **1. Profiles** 


      * Can you identify the different aspects of your profile?

      * Compare their profiles against the portfolio module criteria 


      **2. Understanding Job Descriptions** 


      * Find and share jobs and then collectively review them for suitability 

      * Identify the aspects that make a suitable job description and compare jobs they find against those criteria 


      **3. Collective Job Hunting** 


      * What are the benefits of collective job hunting?

      * How can we make this work best?

      * How will you support this?


      **4. Networking** 


      * Share which networking event you went to last week

      * How do you think it will help your job search?

      * What would you do differently for the next event?


      **5. Interviews** 


      * Practice mock interviews with different people, with two behavioural and two technical questions.

      * Thinking about "Would I hire this person I just interviewed/?" give each other honest feedback on if you would/wouldn't hire them and why.


      **6. Creating sessions together** 


      * Collectively identify and request support on employability/PD areas they need help on
